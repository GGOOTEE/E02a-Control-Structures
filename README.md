# E02a-Control-Structures

Let's start experimenting with some Python code! This is a set of exercises for MSCH-C220; they should give you the tools to help build your first game.
 
This exercise assumes that you have already installed Python, GitHub Desktop, and VS Code, and that you have already created a GitHub account. If that is not the case, please refer to previous exercises.

This repository contains several files that you will need to alter to complete the assignment. Fork this repository (instructions below) and edit the files. Commit and push the changes back to GitHub and turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.

Comments in Python are marked by a # sign (for single-line comments) or three matching quotation marks (''' or """) if a comment requires more than one line. They should also appear in a different color in VS Code. The Python Interpreter ignores comments, so you can safely include any information you want there.

*If you wish your exercise to be graded, please edit the LICENSE file (add the current year and your name).*

Edit README.md to answer the following questions:

- Open main01.py. Before running it, what do you expect this program to do?
      A: Print Greetings!, then say "What is my favorite color?"
  - Now right click on the main01.py window and select “Run Python File in Terminal”. Click in the bottom panel, and answer the question. Describe what happened.
      A: There was nothing else for the terminal to execute so it quit
  - What do you think the program did with what you typed in answer to the question?
      A: Took it as a user input but has no way of tracking it or doing anything with it
- Open main02.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main01.py.
      A: This time it has kept a record of the answer and then prints it to the screen
  - What do you think the color = input() will do?
      A: Creates a variable
  - Run the program in the terminal and answer the question. Did the program do what you expected?
      A: Yes
- Open main03.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main02.py.
      A: Sort of similar to a guessing game, only accepts red as a correct answer, if not red quit
  - What is happening on lines 9–12?
      A: An if statment to set a parameter that if met quit with a certain print and an else with a similar parameter
  - Why are lines 10 and 12 indented?
      A: To follow the parameter and not just print to screen
  - Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you don’t capitalize Red?
      A: If answered with Red, program quits and uses if statement. If answered with red, else statement is used.
  - What does this tell you about "color"?
      A: "color" is just a placeholder variable and can be any character(s)
- Open main04.py. Before running it, describe how this is different than main03.py.
      A: Added 'red' as a possible answer
  - What problem is this trying to solve?
      A: lack of caps
  - Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you use some other capitalization scheme (i.e., “RED” or “reD“)?
      A: only accepts Red and red
- Open main05.py. What do you expect line 9 to do?
      A: any CAP anywhere is acceptable
  - What problem is it trying to solve?
      A: improper CAP usage
  - Run the program and answer the question. What happens if you add spaces before or after the word (i.e., “ RED “ or “ red”)?
      A: spaces are not acceptable
 - Open main06.py. How is line 9 different than in main05.py?
      A: adds the .strip()
   - What would you guess .strip() is doing?
      A: allows spaces
   - Run the program and answer the question. Is there another way of writing “red” that will break this logic?
      A: not actually sure, I dont think so
 - Open main07.py. Before running this program, how do you expect this to be different than main06.py?
      A: adds a function that is a possible answer but does not grant the Correct!
   - What is happening on line 12?
      A: adds a string of characters that is acceptable, creating a grey area, not right or wrong
   - Run the program and answer the question.
      A: red is the correct, pink is close, anything else is try again
 - Open main08.py. What is the purpose of line 9?
      A: To show that the answer will be red but there are other parameters to check
   - Why are lines 10–17 indented?
      A: To follow the while because the while statement goes first witht the !=
   - Run the program. What would happen if line 10 were moved before line 9 (and no longer indented)?
      A: red would be the answer but any other parameter would be ignored
   - Make that change and run the program again. (To end any Python program, you can type ctrl-c)
      A: nothing happened at all
 - Open main09.py. What is happening on line 13?
      A: count is the variable being used to keep track of the attempt, then the count +1 ups the count value by one when one attempt gets made
   - What is the purpose of “count”?
      A: to track user input
   - What is happening on line 22?
      A: I think you meant line 21 and that is where the count value is placed and printed to screen with text to give context
   - Run the program.
 - *Extra credit:* open main10.py. Add a comment to each line describing what it is doing (a comment follows a pound sign [#]).     A: done!
 - *Extra credit:* open main11.py. What is happening on lines 6-11?
      A: creates a string of variables that gets randomized with each time the program is run
Commit your changes and push them back to the repository.

Instructions for forking this repository:
 
Log into your account on [github.com](https://github.com)

Go to the [exercise template page](https://github.com/BL-MSCH-C220-S20/E02a-Control-Structures) on GitHub

There is a button in the top right corner of the page labeled "Fork". Press that now

This will create an independent copy of this repository in your account that you can control and edit

Go to your GitHub home page, and select the new E02a-Control-Structures repository

On that page, you will see a green button labeled "Clone or download". Press that now. You will see a drop down box. Press the "Open in Desktop" button.

This should launch GitHub Desktop. It will ask you for a location (on your computer) where the repository may be cloned (downloaded). Choose a location that will be easy for you to find, and press the blue "Clone" button.

Once GitHub Desktop has cloned (downloaded) the code, it will be responsible for keeping the code on your local computer synchronized with the repository in your GitHub account. Now, open Visual Studio Code, and choose File->Open. Find the folder of the cloned repository and select Open.

In the left (File Explorer) panel, you should see a list of files that comprise this repository

First, edit the file called LICENSE. Replace year and name with the current year and your name. Save this file

Then open README.md. Feel free to remove any extraneous information, and then answer the questions posed in the file. You can add your answers after each question

When the time comes for you to run any of the python files, you can do so by clicking the green arrow in the top right corner of the window or by right-clicking on the code and selecting "Run Python File in Terminal". The results will appear at the bottom. If you don't see "Run Python File in Terminal" in the contextual menu, that is because VS Code doesn't have the Python extension installed. You can do that here: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

When you are done editing the files, return to GitHub Desktop. In the left panel, you should see a list of the files that have changed

At the bottom of the leftmost area, you should see a text box labeled "Summary (required)". Add a message that describes what you have done; these messages are typically stated in the active-present tense. For example, "Updates the LICENSE, README.md, and completes the assignment." Push the blue "Commit to master" button

In the top bar of the window, you should see a button that is labeled "Push origin", push that now

Check out your page on GitHub. You should see the changes you made reflected there, Repeat steps 10 through 16 as necessary

When you are satisfied with your efforts, turn in a URL to your repository on Canvas

If you try to push your changes, and you receive a permission error, it is likely that you are trying to edit the BL-MSCH-C220-S20 copy of the repository rather than your own. Make sure you don't skip the step of forking your own copy and cloning that.

The grading criteria will be as follows:
 
[1 point] Repository contains a description of the project in README.md

1 point will be awarded for answering the questions associated with each of the files

10 points total (+2 points extra credit)
